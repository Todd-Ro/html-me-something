            <p>In college at Wash U., after trying another program out, I transferred into the college of arts
                and sciences and majored in mathematics (statistics track) and economics. 
                After a year of graduate studies in economics and finance at SIUE, I worked for a year full time 
                as a statistician at Market Scope, where I had worked for many years on an as-needed basis doing  
                work that started with mailings. 
                During this time, I also worked one day a week as a legal assistant. 
                At a small law practice called Quality Liability Solutions, I was able to attend a 
                worker's compensation hearing and participate in its settlement conference, do on-site 
                for a landlord/tenant case, and participate in complicated business litigation in which I 
                tagged emails for outgoing discovery, worked on drafting a fourth amended complaint, and 
                used a spreadsheet to calculate a damages estimate based on estimates of lost revenue. 
                As a result of all this, I became very interested in law. 
                So, I went to law school.

            <h5>Law School</h5>
            <article>
                <h6>Saint Louis University School of Law</h6>
                <p>Saint Louis University is a Jesuit University. Its law school, one of four in Missouri, 
                    moved after the 2012-2013 school year from SLU's main campus to a 12-story building downtown
                    that is across the street from the Circuit Court handling state law cases for the City of 
                    Saint Louis.
                </p>
            </article> 
            <p>During law school at Saint Louis University, unexpected personal circumstances beyond my control 
                arose and forced me to take a reduced courseload of two courses my second semester. 
                I ended up taking the second semester of legal writing later in my law school career than most 
                of my classmates, but I was able to take two classes my first summer and the legal clinic my 
                second summer and catch up to graduate on time. 
                During the second summer, I handled an order of protection / guardian ad litem case from 
                start to finish as a student attorney at the legal clinic, as well as handling client intake in 
                landlord/tenant and creating a chonology based on hundreds of pages of medical records. 
                While doing this, I also did an internship at Jackson Lewis law firm, during which time I 
                wrote, under the supervision of the office's managing shareholder, an article on the 
                implications of labor law on employer social media policies. 
                I also worked 15-20 hours a week at HR Block during the winter of my third year of law school, 
                providing guidance to tax professionals on the provisions of the Affordable Care Act for the 
                first tax year that its main provisions were in effect. 
                After graduating, I spent the remainder of 2015 studying for the bar exam, passing it on my 
                attempt, and doing a contract review project for a contact I got in contact with in connection 
                with Quality Liability Solutions.

            <h5>Missouri Protection and Advocacy Services</h5>
            <p>
                Once I got my license, I spent the entirety of 2016 working for Missouri Protection and Advocacy 
                Services (MO P&#38;A). 
                This job was, in some ways, two roles in one. 
                I was a disability rights attorney and a systemic voting rights advocate. 
                As a disability rights attorney, I worked extensively with adult guardianship, including 
                involvement in drafting petitions for restoration of guardianship. 
                I also worked with individuals with mental illnesses, including handling a case evaluating the 
                suitability for unconditional release of an individual who had been found not guilty by reason 
                of insanity and later given conditional release. 
                I was required to acquire medical records for every case and bill time to grants. 
                As a voting rights advocate, I met with voters and carried their concerns to county 
                governments. 
                I worked with a co-worker and with other disability rights organizations as central members of 
                a roundtable centered around advancing disability voting access. 
                For example, myself and two others organized an event with the Saint Louis County Board of 
                elections, and with the help of other disability rights leaders, we were able to bring dozens 
                of visually impaired voters to express their concerns to the Board's directors and receive a 
                presentation from the County on how to use audio voting equipment. 
                I also prepared and delivered voting rights presentations to a wide range of voters, including 
                voters with developmental disorders, and worked with others to prepare packages for use in voter 
                education in future years. 
                In this position, I had the "guardianship spectrum" and the 14th Amendment on the wall in my 
                office.
